# Star Wars Data Terminal

The program runs as a console application using c# .net created with visual studios.

Simply run the program and it will display a list of planets. The program then waits for user input. This user input should match any of the designated id's for the planets in the list displayed in the console.

You can repeat requests by typing in a new Id over and over until you choose to exit the application.

Looking forward to the interview to explain my design choices and what else could be done or how to expand the code for the future, hypothetically.
